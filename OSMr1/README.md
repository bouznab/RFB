# OSM / OpenMano

The OpenMano project has provided a template for describing Virtualized Network Functions (VNFD - VNF Descriptor) and a template to describe Network Services (NSD - Network Service Descriptor). A Virtualized Network Function can be split in VNF Components (VNFCs), which can be described in the VNFD files.

VNFDs and NSDs are described using YAML. See the YAML folder.

In the yang-models folder we have copied the yang schema from OSM data model for NSD and VNFD
