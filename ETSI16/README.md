# VNF and NS descriptors proposed by ETSI NFV ISG in 2016-10

We have identified an example Network Services, composed by 3 VNFs. The NS is represented in the following figure.

We have provided example descriptors for the NS and VNFs.

We have analysed the relationships among the model components and produced the following diagram.
