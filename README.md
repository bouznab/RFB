# RFB - Reusable Functional Blocks
Reusable Functional Blocks for Network Function Virtualization

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is emerging as new architectural concept for the design and implementation of communication networks. In order to fully exploit the NFV potential, we need to re-think the way of designing and modelling the telecommunication services. We aim at supporting a granular and dynamic decomposition of services into Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and of Virtualized Network Functions into smaller components.

We start from the modelling of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and of their composition, as defined by ETSI NFV working group [1]. We generalize the VNF concept into the concept of Reusable Functional Blocks (RFB).

We analyse different description models for VNFs and their composition:
 - the first model proposed by ETSI in [4], see folder ETSI14 
 - the model proposed by the OpenMano project [2] and included in the OSM [3] release 1, see folder OSMr1 
 - the updated model proposed by ETSI in [5] [6], see folder ETSI16
